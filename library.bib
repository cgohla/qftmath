We develop a general and flexible context for differential calculus in derived geometry, including the de Rham algebra and the mixed algebra of polyvector fields. We then introduce the formalism of formal derived stacks and prove formal localization and gluing results. These allow us to define shifted Poisson structures on general derived Artin stacks, and to prove that the non-degenerate Poisson structures correspond exactly to shifted symplectic forms. Shifted deformation quantization for a derived Artin stack endowed with a shifted Poisson structure is discussed in the last section. This paves the road for shifted deformation quantization of many interesting derived moduli spaces, like those studied in [PTVV] and many others.},

In the smooth category, we complement Poincaré duality by proving the compactly supported Poincaré lemmas for both differential and integral forms, filling a gap in the literature. In the relevant case of integral forms, this makes apparent the algebraic nature of the Berezin integration in the odd directions. We then use our results to study supergravity. In particular, we describe supergravity in dimension three via higher Cartan structures, which can be regarded as certain classes of connections taking values in L∞superalgebras. We then use relative Poincaré duality to state a general form of the action principle in a mathematically rigorous manner. This interpolates in a unified fashion between two equivalent formulations of supergravity, one based on the superspace approach and the other on the group manifold approach in the physics literature.},

  abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers about quantization in the context of derived algebraic geometry. In this first part, we introduce the notion of n-shifted symplectic structures (n-symplectic structures for short), a generalization of the notion of symplectic structures on smooth varieties and schemes, meaningful in the setting of derived Artin n-stacks (see [HAG-II, To2]). We prove that classifying stacks of reductive groups, as well as the derived stack of perfect complexes, carry canonical 2-symplectic structures. Our main existence theorem states that for any derived Artin stack F equipped with an n-symplectic structure, the derived mapping stack Map(X, F ) is equipped with a canonical (n − d)-symplectic structure as soon a X satisfies a CalabiYau condition in dimension d. These two results imply the existence of many examples of derived moduli stacks equipped with n-symplectic structures, such as the derived moduli of perfect complexes on Calabi-Yau varieties, or the derived moduli stack of perfect complexes of local systems on a compact and oriented topological manifold. We explain how the known symplectic structures on smooth moduli spaces of simple objects (e.g. simple sheaves on Calabi-Yau surfaces, or simple representations of π1 of compact Riemann surfaces) can be recovered from our results, and that they extend canonically as 0-symplectic structures outside of the smooth locus of simple objects. We also deduce new existence statements, such as the existence of a natural (−1)symplectic structure (whose formal counterpart has been previously constructed in [Co, Co-Gw]) on the derived mapping scheme Map(E, T ∗X), for E an elliptic curve and T ∗X is the total space of the cotangent bundle of a smooth scheme X. Canonical (−1)-symplectic structures are also shown to exist on Lagrangian intersections, on moduli of sheaves (or complexes of sheaves) on Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and on moduli of representations of π1 of compact topological 3-manifolds. More generally, the moduli sheaves on higher dimensional varieties are shown to carry canonical shifted symplectic structures (with a shift depending on the dimension).},

  abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers devoted to lay the foundations of Algebraic Geometry in homotopical and higher categorical contexts. In this first part we investigate a notion of higher topos. For this, we use S-categories (i.e. simplicially enriched categories) as models for certain kind of ∞-categories, and we develop the notions of S-topologies, S-sites and stacks over them. We prove in particular, that for an S-category T endowed with an S-topology, there exists a model category of stacks over T , generalizing the model category structure on simplicial presheaves over a Grothendieck site of A. Joyal and R. Jardine. We also prove some analogs of the relations between topologies and localizing subcategories of the categories of presheaves, by proving that there exists a one-to-one correspodence between S-topologies on an S-category T , and certain left exact Bousfield localizations of the model category of pre-stacks on T . Based on the above results, we study the notion of model topos introduced by C. Rezk, and we relate it to our model categories of stacks over S-sites.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the connection of holomorphic two-dimensional factorization algebras and vertex algebras which has been made precise in the forthcoming book of Costello–Gwilliam. We provide a construction of the Virasoro vertex algebra starting from a local Lie algebra on the complex plane. Moreover, we discuss an extension of this factorization algebra to a factorization algebra on the category of Riemann surfaces. The factorization homology of this factorization algebra is computed as the correlation functions. We provide an example of how the Virasoro factorization algebra implements conformal symmetry of the beta–gamma system using the method of effective BV quantization.},
